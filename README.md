# Working with the output of PrediNet


## Setup

Honestly, it's better off if you just use google collab and run the PrediNetExample.ipynb in that environment. The setup to use pytorch geometry is tricky but reference this url if you do decide to download them on your machine: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html#installation-via-pip-wheels

## Run

Like I said, I would just recommend running this on google collab but if you're able to install all the dependencies in requirements.txt, you can just run `python PrediNetExample.py`.
